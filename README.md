# Dream Home 🏡 🌟

Dream Home is an online platform designed to assist users in identifying their interior design preferences. Leveraging machine learning technology, the platform analyzes user preferences by evaluating images and administering quiz tests. Additionally, users have the opportunity to explore and discover homestays or houses available for rent that align with their specific design style.
